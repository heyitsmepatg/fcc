        <h3>Obituary</h3>
        <p>
          Charles Fernando Gorospe, 48, died Saturday, March 16, 2013. He is the youngest son of Shirley and the late Cornelio Gorospe. He was born in Rochester, NY. Chuck is survived by his wife Michelle, who he happily wed in 1988 at St. Paul s Catholic Church in Jacksonville, FL. The Gorospe family made Rock Hill, SC their home in 1993, where they have joyfully raised seven beautiful children Andrew, 22; Christopher, 19; Patrick, 17; Sophia, 14; James, 12; Mary Abigail, 9; and Edward, 4. Chuck is also survived by his six siblings, all who reside in Jacksonville, FL William, Douglas, Dorothy (Woody), Lisa, Maria (Paul), and Susan (Billy). He grew up in the light of faith and the love of family in Jacksonville, FL. In addition to his siblings, Chuck is also survived by many loving nephews and nieces, colleagues from Bojangles, Inc, and a myriad of friends. Chuck, who had obtained an MBA from University of North Florida, always valued his family above all else. He was a very dedicated husband and father as he attended every soccer game, musical performance, and kindergarten graduation that he could, while also sending every child through Catholic school. Chuck built a strong family and participated actively in the St. Anne Church choir as a bass/guitar player. Music was an integral fabric of Chuck s life as witnessed when he played with his band, BorderLyne. When his tragic death arrived, he bequeathed a rich legacy of faith and love to his wife and children.
